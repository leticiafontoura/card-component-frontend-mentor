### Built with

### What I learned

A cool thing that I learned was to use **em** and ```overflow: hidden``` to properly set a border-radius to a div.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about units such as vh, vw, em, and how to properly set a background-image to a container.
